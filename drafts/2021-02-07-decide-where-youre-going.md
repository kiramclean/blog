I pulled this out of a longer post about levelling up when I realized that so much of how you go about levelling up as a software developer hinges on where you want your career to go. There are a lot of things that still apply regardless of your goals, but at the end of the day you can't get you want to go if you don't even know what that is. These are some thoughts about different things worth considering if you're in a season of feeling pretty settled at work but wondering what's next.

## Saving yourself time and energy

For me the main reason to put effort into thinking about things like my future is that it saves me time and energy when it's time to make decisions.

Also think about the structure and dynamic of your working relationships. Maybe you like working with a big team other programmers, maybe you prefer working with just a couple other people. Maybe you want to manage the team or make decisions. Maybe you want even more control, like the power to decide what projects you even take on in the first place. These and anything else you can dream up are possible working arrangements. Being an employee can be a great path for some people, but don't get stuck in the trap of thinking it's the only option just because it's usually presented as the default.
