title: Denazifying A Country
---

A certain group of people are saying it's "divisive" to address the current situation. That calling a Nazi a Nazi is inflammatory. I see the opposite way. Not addressing the current  America is clearly already divided. Some people want to have elections to determine who will govern the country, and some people want "trial by combat". They want to have a war to see who will govern the country. That's not a difference of opinion. That's ane existential crisis. Taking advantage of an existential crisis to usurp power (even a manufactured one, like America's) is one of the oldest moves in the authoritarian playbook. 

Some people are saying it's "divisice"

This isn't a technical post. I feel like it's a bit tonedeaf to just continue writing about software and tech right now as though everything is normal. It's not, and I think it's important that we acknowledge that things are very not normal right now. I do have some thoughts on what role tech companies have played in concocting this whole situation, but I don't think pointing fingers is productive right now.

I've been thinking a lot about evreything going on the USA this past week. It's deeply unsettling and disorienting to me. I found myself reflecting on things I've learned about how other societies have moved on from messes like this. America[1] is not the first country to have a violent militia attempt to overthrow its government. I studied German language, culture, and history in university and spent a year living there during that time. Moving on from violent autocracy is a topic a lot of Germans are still grappling with. It's a work in progress, but they have a lot of good thoughts about it.

I wanted to share some of those thoughts here. These are some of the steps, roughly in order, that helped Germany move on from the capture of its democracy by violent authoritarians. The situation is of course very different in the USA, but there are many parallels. There is no doubt that American democracy is in peril, and I am watching, along with the rest of the world, to see how they'll decide to move forward.

## Reach Rock Bottom

It's not clear this has happened in America yet. The first step toward denazifying a country is admitting that you have a Nazi problem. By "Nazi" here I mostly mean someone who advocates for a violent, totalitarian form of government. 

For some reason a lot of the American intelligentsia seems to still be debating the roots of their problems. There seem to be many intelligent people who seriously beleive that racism is a problem of the past and America is no longer a racist country, despite decades of evidence showing racial minorities are disproportionately represented at every level of the justice system, starting from their first encounters with it via police (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3868476/), and that they account for a disproportionate number of violent police encounters (https://scholar.harvard.edu/fryer/publications/empirical-analysis-racial-differences-police-use-force).

I happen to believe white supremacy and America's deeply racist foundations are at the root of its current upheaval, but I don't think it's actually crucial to agree on that before deciding to do something about it. There is no reason why conservative thought leaders cannot join forces with progressives in condemning totalitarianism, in theory, regardless of what is motivating it.

Dale Carnegie famously said the only way to get someone to do something is to make them want to do it. I think he's right, and more Americans need to start wanting to fix the totalitarian tendencies among their peers.

## Don't Blame the Average Followers

At the beginning of the official denazification process, the occupying American forces started by rounding up all Nazi party members, putting the burden of proof that they were not in fact complicit in war crimes on the individuals themselves. This presumption of guilt led to an inflation of credentials and unsurprisingly caught a lot of innocent people the wrong way.


This is a hard one and offends many people's deep need for vengeance and sense of justice. When we're wronged it's very natural to want payback and for the perpetrators to suffer for their crimes. Many people's first instinct is to demand retribution, but the productive thing to do in this situation is harder. We need to have mercy on regular voters. Yes, they have been conned into supporting an aspiring dictator. I am one of those people who has a strong need for vengeance. I believe every single person who

And yes, I believe anyone who has supported the President in any way over the  74 million people voted for the President, and it's naive to think any significant proportion of them will change their politics any time soon. It's tempting to demonize the rank and file and 



























[1] I use "USA" and "America" interchangeably to refer to "The United States of America". I know America is a continent and not a country and I don't mean to cause any offence to Central and South Americans by presuming "America" refers only to North America. It's just that in Canada, where I'm writing from, anyone who says "America" or "American" is pretty much always talking about the USA
