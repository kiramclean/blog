If you do anything for long enough you'll eventually get better at it. If you stay in your job for long enough you'll eventually get promoted. You don't just have to roll the dice and hope things work out in your favour, though. You can advance your career intentionally. In my experience the fastest way to advance in your career as a software developer is, counter-intuitively, to focus on the non-technical parts of writing software.

Getting good at writing code is definitely important, but it's also the thing you're most likely to pick up on the job and the thing most discussed elsewhere on the topic of levelling up. It also has diminishing returns. You'll reach a point (surprisingly early in your career, in my experience), where going deeper won't get you as far as going wide will.

That's what this post is about. There are a bunch of skills that don't really get taught in formal education settings but that you also won't necessarily just develop passively. Those are the ones that are worth focusing on because they'll accelerate your career which gives you the freedom to shape it the way you want.

## Decide where you're going

For me the whole point of levelling up was to gain freedom. I like being in control of how and when and where I work. I have a stronger than normal aversion to micro-managers, to the point where I don't even really like having a manager at all. I also don't really want to _be_ a manager, though, so I prioritize autonomy and freedom in my career.

It's different for everyone, but it's worth spending some time thinking about where you want to be 1, 5, 10 years down the road. Maybe you want to work on a small team and spend most of your time writing code. Maybe you want to manage the team. Maybe you want to take an even higher-level role and decide what projects get taken on in the first place. Also remember that being a salaried employee is far from the only option. You could work as a consultant or be self employed and do contracts, or even make your own products to sell and add value that way. Being an employee is a good path for some people, and not all countries give people the entrepreneurial freedom to work for themselves or start a small business, but in many cases it can still be a totally viable option. My point is just to watch out you don't fall into the trap of thinking that being an employee is the only option just because it's so often presented as the default.

Everyone has different priorities -- autonomy, salary, flexibility, good co-workers, a certain tech stack, decision-making power, responsibility, etc. Whatever yours are it's easier to know in advance, for two main reasons:

1. You don't waste time applying for and interviewing at companies only to realize once you have an offer that you don't actually _want_ to accept it
2. You don't have to make rushed decisions about which interviews or offers to accept when you're in the midst of interview chaos

Whatever your priorities are for your career, it's worth setting at least some vague goals for your career trajectory because it'll give you a much higher chance of ending up somewhere you actually want to be.

## Paths to improvement

One way to add more value
I already mentioned
There are a lot of technical areas you can focus on





----------------------

## Scratch


there are a lot of other areas you can work on that will accelerate your career much faster than becoming a better programmer. There is also loads of great advice out there already on how to learn new technical skills well, so I'm going to focus on all the other stuff.

## Paths to improvement

- different/adjacent disciplines
- levels of your own stack
- other langauges/styles
- go deeper with your current skills

## Practice non-programming skills

Growing your technical skills is definitely necessary and it's totally possible to make a career going super deep and becoming a leading expert in a very particular niche. There's another path though, for those of us who either don't want to or can't pull that off for whatever reason.

The value you add to your team is mostly in the non-technical skills you bring. Once you get to a certain level, and it can happen surprisingly early, in my experience, like a few years in, you and pretty much everyone you work with will more or less just know how to write code that works. Implementing a solution to a specific problem is the main thing most programming education focuses on, but a few years into your career this becomes the easy part.

Designing a solution so you know what to even implement is harder. Figuring out what the problem even is in the first place is even harder than that. Being able to contribute at these levels makes you a dramatically more useful team member than if you're unable to contribute these things but were 50% better at writing code.




### Especially communication

One thing a lot of top developers have in common is that they are great communicators. They write books, give talks, and mentor other people. Being an amazing programmer is good, but it can only take you so far if you can't articulate your thoughts well to others. There's that quote from Jerry Weinberg:

> No matter how it looks at first, it's always a people problem.

He's not wrong. Improving your communication skills will do wonders for your career (and your life, btw). here are some examples of what that looks like, concretely, in a software engineering context:
- give talks about stuff you're learning or working on
- pay attention in meetings where people are talking about _who_ wants _what_ built, and practice contributing technical considerations to conversations about what to build. For example sometimes people will be debating which feature to prioritize, but if they knew one was going to take a week and another one a few months, the decision might be way easier for them
- learn to explain your ideas for solutions to your co-workers. Maybe you can think of a more elegant solution to a technical problem, but in order for it to be considered you need to be able to explain it and compare it to other solutions on the table
- Review your co-workers code and leave useful feedback
- Pair with your co-workers on problems. There are different styles of pairing and the way that works depends heavily on the personalities of the people doing it, but no matter how you do you need to be good at communicating for it to go well

- just having a brilliant idea is not enough
- you will rarely have the autonomy to just run off and do you awesome idea, and in the end you're likely to realize it's not as awesome as you thought it was anyway and would have benefited a lot from seeking more input from other people


## Build your network along with your skills

Gaining more skills like these ones and improving your existing technical skills is going to make you a top contributor to your teams. But, at the end of the day, only the people you directly work with will know that. Participating in an active community of professionals is really useful because it gives you opportunities to share your work with a broader community. A lot of communities have a sort of "show and tell" kind of event once in a while, and if you're hanging out in a crowd like this your work will also just come up naturally. Building connections with technical people is amazing, because next time they hear about some great opportunity, they might be reminded of some project you were telling them about and be able to recommend you or similar.

Don't worry about being too introverted to meet other programmers. They are mostly all feeling the same.


## Think big-picture

- you can dramatically increase your value to a company by caring about more than just the tasks someone else puts in front of you.
- ways you can be more valuable
    + foresee problems that someone without your skills might miss -- looming deadlines that are not going to be met, estimates that are way under, tech debt that's piling up
    + try not to come off purely negative or only whining, but offer solutions
    + "this project is going to take longer than we thought. maybe we can wrap up what we're in the middle of over the next two weeks then meet with stakeholders to figure out together what we can cut from the original scope of the project"
    + "we can implement X feature in Y way, but that will cause problems for developing Z feature we talked about doing next. we could do it this other way instead which might take a little longer now but will allow us to extend it later"
    + "client X doesn't seem to know what but seems to be steering the project, so there's no one at the wheel. maybe we could offer to some help figuring out a bigger vision for the product."
