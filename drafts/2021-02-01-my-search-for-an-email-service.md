title: My Search For A Mailing List Provider

Recently I wanted to add a way to subscribe via email for my blog, because not everyone who reads uses RSS or wants to subscribe that way. I thought what I was looking for was pretty simple, but I had a really hard time finding something that fit. I know, I know, most people will just say "pick whatever works and move on with your life", but that's not me. I hate using software that's more complicated than it needs to be, and I have a really hard time (like, emotionally) settling for sub-par until I'm convinced there really isn't any other option. I'm working on that but in the mean time I can't help it, so here we are.

In case anyone else is wondering what the current state of email services is, these are my notes about what I found.

## Requirements

Going into this, these are the features I needed:

- Confirmation of new subscribers (I later learned this is called "double opt-in")
- No reCaptchas, those are fucking annoying, and also depend on Google's [typical, sleazy antics](https://www.fastcompany.com/90369697/googles-new-recaptcha-has-a-dark-side)
- Some other way to prevent bot sign ups
- A sign up form that [works without JS](https://kryogenix.org/code/browser/everyonehasjs.html)
- No tracking or spy pixels embedded in emails. I ignore most emails that do this and [so do increasingly more people](https://twitter.com/tomrossi7/status/1352264310966415362).
- Simple, plain text emails. I also ignore most emails that have colourful boxes and images all over the place. I don't want my emails to look like spam, I want them to look like a letter from a friend (because that's kind of what I want them to be!)
- A business model that does not rely on exploiting users

These are a couple of things that I wanted, but would have went without given enough of my must-haves were met:
- A clean, easy interface to write those plain emails
- Simple, raw embeddable form ready to copy
- Simple UI in general. Ideally not having to contact support to figure out to set up a basic mailing list.
- Being able to control what users see every step of the way, i.e. redirecting to a custom page after signup, after confirmation, and after unsubscribe.

Basically I just wanted a simple way to manage an email list. I'm not trying to do "email marketing" or "campaigns" or whatever. I just want to send out a normal email about once a month to a list of people who asked to receive it. I need something _slightly_ fancier than just a plain form collecting email addresses and sending those emails manually, though, beacuse I want confirmation emails and unsubscribes to be handled automatically.

These are the services I tried and what I thought of them.

## ConvertKit

This one is used by some newsletters I like and seems like a cool company
