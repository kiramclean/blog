These are the source files for my [personal website](https://kiramclean.com). I write here about things I'm thinking, learning, doing, and reading. Topics vary pretty wildly, but the main ones on my mind lately are

- tech and how the industry can be a force for good instead of evil
- spirituality and what role religion can have in the pursuit of spiritual growth
- what it means to do good and live well, especially through the lens of effective altruism

## About the website

My website is built with [morphy](https://github.com/kiramclean/morphy), a simple static site generator I made, and served by netlify via this github repo. If you spot a typo or other problem you can [make an issue](https://github.com/kiramclean/blog/issues/new) here. I use the [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/) stylesheet to try to make my css behave predictably, but otherwise all the css on the website is hand-rolled and intentionally minimalist by me. I have a [style guide](https://kiramclean.com/style-guide/) for reference, with a sampling of all the elements found on the website. The styles and the idea for a style guide where I can see how everything looks in one place are inspired by a great designer I've had the pleasure of working with, [Benjy Stanton](https://www.benjystanton.co.uk).

## About Me

I write software for a living, mostly in Clojure, and spend most of my time in Montreal, Canada. I work from home and love travelling when possible. I often spend many months of the year in other places. I love warm weather, but have only Canadian citizenship so I'm perpetually seeking sunny destinations that are safe, welcoming, and affordable.
