I consider tracking what people do around the internet to be virtual stalking and believe it should be illegal, just like stalking someone in real life is.  I do not and will never try to stalk you around the internet. I believe if a company wants to know what their customers are up to, they should just ask instead of spying on them.

## Analytics

I use [Fathom analytics](https://usefathom.com/) on this website so that I can tell which posts are popular, because that influences my decisions about what to write (sometimes). Fathom is a company that [hates surveillance](https://usefathom.com/blog/privacy-matters-2021), like I do, and they only collect anonymous statistics about what pages are visited and from where; basically it's a hit counter. You can see exactly the same data I see on my [public analytics dashboard](https://app.usefathom.com/share/ezhczsen/kiramclean.com). Fathom does not use cookies and [complies with the GDPR, ePrivacy (including PECR), COPPA and CCPA](https://usefathom.com/compliance) by default. They've written a [great technical deep dive](https://usefathom.com/data) about how they collect analytics if you want even more details. I also have [Fathom configured](https://github.com/kiramclean/blog/blob/0c7e031ecee1342b46486e54a6912e111867a44f/site/_partials/head.mustache#L14) to honour [Do Not Track](https://allaboutdnt.com/), in case you really don't want even anonymous statistics gathered and have that set in your browser. 

## Newsletter

I manage my mailing list and send out my newsletter with [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/). It's an independent software company run by a guy in Seattle who is [not interested in your data or mine](https://buttondown.email/features/privacy). I have opted out of tracking email analytics, so nobody is recording when or where or how frequently you open my emails. That's your business. This is the explanation from Buttondown's admin panel:

I have no interest in collecting any personal information about you. This approach means I might occasionally ask what people are interested in reading more of, or what people are enjoying, but responding to any such questions is always optional and I will never harass you or spy on you. I love hearing from people who read my writing, but I only want to correspond with people who _want_ to hear from me.

You can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time which will delete your email address from my mailing list.

## Contact

If you still have any questions or concerns about any of this you can reach out to me anytime at [contact@kiramclean.com](mailto:contact@kiramclean.com).
