## About This Blog

Hi! I'm Kira. This is my personal website. I write here about things I'm thinking, learning, doing, and reading. Topics vary pretty wildly, but the main ones on my mind lately are
- tech and how the industry can be a force for good instead of evil
- spirituality and what role religion can have in the pursuit of spiritual growth
- what it means to do good and live well, especially through the lens of effective altruism

You can hear about new posts via [RSS](/feed.xml), [email](/newsletter), or by [following me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/kiraemclean) (though I also tweet about a lot of other, non-blog-related things there, too!). 

## About This Website

This website is built with [morphy](https://github.com/kiramclean/morphy), a simple static site generator I made, and served by [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/products/build/) via [this github repo](https://github.com/kiramclean/blog). If you spot a typo or other problem you can [make an issue](https://github.com/kiramclean/blog/issues/new) there. I use the [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/) stylesheet to try to make my css behave predictably, but otherwise all the css on this website is hand-rolled and intentionally minimalist by me. I have a [style guide](/style-guide) for reference, with a sampling of all the elements found on this website. The styles and the idea for a style guide where I can see how everything looks in one place are inspired by a great designer I've had the pleasure of working with, [Benjy Stanton](https://www.benjystanton.co.uk/).

## About Me

I write software for a living, mostly in [Clojure](https://clojure.org/), and spend most of my time in Montreal, Canada. I work from home and love travelling when possible. I often spend many months of the year in other places. I love warm weather, but have only Canadian citizenship so I'm perpetually seeking sunny destinations that are safe, welcoming, and affordable.

I love hearing from people and talking about what's on my mind, i.e. the kind of stuff I write about here. You can find me on twitter as [@kiraemclean](https://twitter.com/kiraemclean) or email me at [contact@kiramclean.com](mailto:contact@kiramclean.com).
